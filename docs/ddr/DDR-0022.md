Context

The Elk E27 protocol uses two distinct transport behaviors over a single TCP connection:

1. Unframed, clear-text JSON messages
2. Framed, encrypted binary messages

These behaviors vary by session phase and are not interchangeable. Incorrect framing or encryption results in silent panel failures and non-obvious timeouts.

---

Decision

The E27 session lifecycle is formally defined as follows:

Phase 1: Discovery
- Panel sends discovery JSON (e.g., ELKWC2017)
- Client sends API_LINK request
- Messages are clear-text JSON
- Messages are NOT framed
- Messages are NOT encrypted

Phase 2: Linking
- Client sends API_LINK request as clear-text JSON (unframed)
- Panel responds with framed, encrypted (schema-0) data
- Client decrypts response to obtain link key and link HMAC

Phase 3: Hello
- Client sends hello request as clear-text JSON (unframed)
- Panel responds with clear-text JSON containing encrypted fields
- Session key and session HMAC are decrypted using the link key

Phase 4: Authenticated Session
- All subsequent messages are:
  - Framed using E27 link-layer framing
  - Encrypted using the session key
  - Processed via the presentation layer

---

Implementation Rule

The session module SHALL be responsible for:
- Determining whether outgoing messages are framed or unframed
- Routing incoming bytes to either:
  - Direct JSON parsing for unframed traffic
  - The link-layer deframer for framed traffic

Lower layers MUST NOT infer session phase or framing requirements.

---

Rationale

This strict separation:
- Matches observed panel behavior
- Prevents accidental framing of API_LINK and hello messages
- Centralizes protocol state decisions in session.py
- Simplifies debugging and recovery from silent failures

The panel’s silent failure behavior makes this separation mandatory.

---

Consequences

- session.py is the authoritative owner of session state
- linking.py manages the API_LINK exchange but does not own socket state
- presentation.py assumes encrypted, framed payloads only
- Any future protocol extensions must explicitly define framing requirements

This decision is binding for all E27 session handling.
